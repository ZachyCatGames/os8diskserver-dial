These tools are from the "8tools" suite.  You can obtain the full set of
tools and documentation from
	http://svn.so-much-stuff.com/svn/trunk/pdp8/8tools
with the a web browser, or better, with the command
	svn co http://svn.so-much-stuff.com/svn/trunk/pdp8/8tools
if you have installed subversion.

These tools require Perl to be installed in order to work.
