?ARG	The following argument combinations are illegal:

	1)	,	(no argument before comma)
	2)	m,n,	(more than two arguments)
	3)	H,	(because H=B,Z is already two arguments)
?MEM	The current operation requires more memory storage for text
	(in the text buffer) than TECO has available.
	There is room for at most 4000 (decimal) characters of text.
?FER	File error can mean one of five things:

	1)	Input file not found on an ER command
	2)	Error while trying to enter the output file
		on an EW or EB command
	3)	The device specified in a file specification does not exist
	4)	EB command given on a non-file-structured device
	5)	Attempt to perform an EB on a file with a .BK extension
?FUL	An output command such as P, EX, EC, EG, PW, N, or FN would
	have written more data to the output file than there was room
	allocated on the output device.  The data that would have overflowed
	the output device is still in the text buffer and has not been
	written out.  You can close the output file with an EF command
	and then open a new output file and continue editing.  When you
	are all done, PIP can be used to merge the two output files back
	into one.
?IEC	The only commands starting with the letter E are
	EB, EC, ED, EF, EG, EH, EK, EO, ER, ES, ET, EU, EW, EX and EY.
	When used as a command (i.e. not in a text argument), E may not be
	followed by any character except one of these.

	Secondary I/O streams (EA, EP, EI), magtape commands (EM), wildcard
	lookups (EN), and device initialization (EZ) are not available
	in TECO-8.

	The ES flag does not currently do anything.

?IFC	The only commands starting with the letter F are FS, F_, and FN.
	When used as a command (other than EF or in a text argument),
	F may not be followed by any character other than one of these.
	The S, _, or N must immediately follow the F with no intervening
	spaces or commands.  The two characters in an F command may not be
	split across macros.

	The FR command is not implemented in TECO-8.
?IFN	File specifications must be in the form dev:filnam.ext
	where dev, filname, and ext are alphanumeric.  The file
	specification may optionally end with a /S which means
	ignore end-of-file on any subsequent input.  No characters
	other than the ones specified may appear in a text argument
	to an ER, EW, or EB command.
?ILL	The specified character is not defined as a valid TECO command.
	(The W command is only available with VT support.)
?INP	An I/O error occurred while trying to read from the input file.
?IQC	The only valid " commands are
	"C, "R		execute if alphanumeric
	"E, "=		execute if = 0
	"F, "U		execute if unsuccessful
	"L, "<		execute if less than 0
	"G, ">		execute if greater than 0
	"N		execute if not equal to 0
	"S, "T		execute if successful
	"D		execute if digit
	"A		execute if alphabetic

	The commands "V, and "W are not available in TECO-8.
?IQN	The Q register name specified by a command such as Q, U, X, G, %, or M
	must be a letter (A-Z) or a digit (0-9).

	Pseudo-Q-registers _ and * are not available in TECO-8.
?ISA	The argument preceding a search command indicates the number
	of times a match must be found before the search is considered
	successful.  This argument must be greater than 0.
	Backward searches and bounded searches are not permitted in TECO-8.

?UTM	A command macro being executed from a Q-register terminated
	with an incomplete command, such as

	1)	macro ended with with only one character of a two character
		command (such as F, E, or ^)
	2)	macro ended with a command that requires a Q-register name
		(such as X, G, M, %, Q, U, or ^U) but no Q-register
		name was specified
	3)	macro ended with a command that takes a string argument
		(such as ERfile$, Itext$, Stext$, Otag$, etc.)
		and the text argument was not properly terminated by
		an ALTMODE (or the specified delimiter if the at-sign
		form was used)
	4)	An O command was issued and the specified tag was not
		found in that macro (subsequent to the start of the
		current iteration)
?BNI	There is a right angle bracket not matched by a left angle bracket
	somewhere to its left.  (Note: an iteration in a macro stored in a
	Q-register must be complete within the Q-register.)
?NAE	The command n= or n== causes the value of n to be typed.
	The = command must be preceded by either a specific numeric
	argument or a command that returns a numeric value.
?NAQ	The " command must be preceded by a single numeric argument
	on which the decision to execute the following commands
	or skip to the matching ' (or |) is based.
?NAU	The command nUq stores the value n in Q-register q.  The U
	command must be preceded by either a specific numeric argument
	or a command that returns a numeric value.
?NFO	Before giving an output command (P, PW, N, EC, or EG) it is
	necessary to open an output file by use of an EB, EW,
	MAKE or TECO command.
	To prevent possible loss of data, the EX, EC, and EG commands
	will be aborted if there is no output file open and there is
	text in the text buffer.  The HKEX command will always work.
	To abort TECO immediately, use the ^C command.
?POP	The argument specified with a J, C, or R command must
	point to a position within the current size of the text buffer,
	i.e. between 0 and Z inclusive.
	The argument to commands that reference pointer positions,
	such as m,nP or m,nK must reference buffer pointer
	positions bewteen 0 and Z inclusive.
?DTB	An nD command was issued with an argument that was so large that
	the command would delete character positions outside the current
	buffer.  The D commmand may only delete existing characters.
	No characters were deleted.
?OUT	An error occurred while trying to write to the output file,
	or there was not enough room to enter the file on an EW or EB
	command.
?SNI	The semicolon command was used at command level.
	The ; command may only be used within a string of commands
	enclosed by angle brackets, i.e. an iteration field.
?SRH	A search command not preceded by a colon modifier and not within
	an iteration has failed to find the specified character string.
	After an S (or FS) search fails, the buffer pointer is left
	positioned at the beginning of the buffer.  After an N or _
	search fails, the last page of the input file has been input and, in
	the case of N, output, and the buffer cleared.
	The string that you were searching for is shown in the one-line
	error message.  Note that the special search characters
	CTRL/N, CTRL/S, and CTRL/X are indicated in this string as
	<NOT>, <SEP>, and <ANY> respectively.

	Backward searches and bounded searches are not permitted in TECO-8.
	Anchored searches are also not permitted.

	Note that the action of "^" in search strings depends on the
	setting of the ED&1 bit.  If 0, then ^ means convert next character
	to its control character.

?STL	The maximum length of a search string is 31 characters
	(38 characters if you have no VR12 or VT scope support).
?UTC	An incomplete command has been given.
	This could be caused by any of the following:

	1)	A command that requires a text string (such as
		@ER/file/, @S/text/, ^Atext^A, etc.) ended the
		command string, but the text argument was not properly
		terminated.
	2)	An O command was issued and the specified tag was not found
		in the command string subsequent to the start of the
		current iteration.
?PDO	Your macros and iterations have been nested too deeply.
?QMO	There is not enough room allocated to Q-register storage and
	command string storage to satisfy the current command.
	If you were typing a command string when you got this error
	message, you might be able to recover most of the command string
	by immediately typing CTRL/S as the very next command, thus
	putting the previous command string into Q-register Z.

?NYA	The Y command may not be preceded by a numeric argument.
	To yank multiple pages, use the n<Y> command.
?NPA	The argument to a P command specifies the number of times the
	P command is to be executed.  This argument must be positive.
?NCA	The number before a comma refers to a position within the
	text buffer.  This value must be between 0 and Z inclusive
	and may not be negative.
?NYI	The case control commands ^V and ^W are not available in TECO-8.
	To get TECOs version number, issue the EO command.
	To use the watch command (with VR12 or VT support) use the W command.
	Also, the push [ and pop ] commands are not implemented in TECO-8.
?UIS	The only I/O switch that is defined in TECO-8 is the /S switch.
?WLO	The system device is write-locked.
?YCA	To prevent accidental loss of data, the commands Y, _ and F_
	will abort if there is text in the text buffer and there is an
	output file open.  If you don't care about the output file,
	you can kill it with the EK command.  The HKY command is always
	permitted.

	Yank protection can be disabled by clearing bit 10 of the ED flag,
	i.e. by issuing the TECO command:	ED&1ED
	This command may be put into your TECO.INI if you dislike yank
	protection.
?CCL	You issued a command of the form EGcommand$ and the specified
	command was too large (more than 43 characters) or CCL.SV
	was not found on the system device.
?XAB	Execution of your TECO command or command input was aborted because
	you typed a CTRL/C.  To get out of TECO, type a CTRL/C immediately
	after TECO's prompt.  If you accidentally got back to monitor
	level there is a slight chance that you can get back to TECO
	by using ODT to restart your core image at location 203.
?ICE	The character CTRL/E is not permitted within a search string.
	This character is reserved for special use in future versions
	of TECO-8.  Note that the presence of a "^E" in the string
	printout within the ?SRH error message denotes the presence
	of one of the special match control constructs, CTRL/N, CTRL/X,
	or CTRL/S.
?NAB	The one's complement command ^_ was used without a numeric
	argument.  The form of the command is n^_ and the command
	returns the one's complement of the argument n.
	^_ is not a unary operator and must be used after a numeric
	argument (not before it).
?UE_	The commands EA, EI, EL, EM, EN, EP, EV, and EZ are not
	implemented in TECO-8.  The only legal E commands are

	EBfilespec$	Edit Backup
	EC		closes output file after moving across input
	EF		closes output file
	EG$		performs EX then re-executes last compile class cmd
	EGcommand$	performs EX then executes command specified
	EK		kills output file
	ERfilespec$	Opens file for input
	EWfilespec$	Opens file for output
	EX		moves across input to output file, then closes it
			and exits TECO
	EY		unprotected Y command

	The following commands are valid flags: ED, EH, EJ, EO, ES, ET and EU.
