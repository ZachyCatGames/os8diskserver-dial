/	SDSKSY OS/8 SYSTEM HANDLER

/	SERIAL INTERFACE-BASED DISK SYSTEM DEVICE HANDLER [USE WITH PC SERVER].

/	LAST EDIT: 19-NOV-2016 CJL

/	EDIT HISTORY.

/	19-NOV-2016	CHARLES LASNER	BUG FIX AND OTHER THINGS.

/	NOTABLE CHANGES.

/	1) FIXED BUG ASSOCIATED WITH PRE-OMNIBUS SERIAL INTERFACES.

/	2) REMOVED LAST REMNANTS OF CONTROL-C CHECKING CODE ALREADY DEACTIVATED.

/	3) THE EMBEDDED MANUAL BOOTSTRAP CODE IS NOW ONE SHORTER; A WORD THAT IS
/	   MERELY READ IN BY RUNNING THE BOOTSTRAP WAS INCLUDED WITHIN THE BOOTSTRAP.

/	4) THE LONG AWAITED MAJOR SOURCE CODE CLEANUP TO INCLUDE [BETTER] COMMENTS AND
/	   CONFORMANCE WITH PDP-8 SOURCE CODE CONVENTIONS.

/	5) RELEASE UPDATED TO VERSION G.

/	06-AUG-2016	CHARLES LASNER	CODE CLEANUP.

/	NOTABLE CHANGES.

/	1) ADDS THIS EDIT HISTORY.

/	2) REMOVES MINOR INCOMPATIBLE SOURCE CODE QUIRKS.  [NOTE: ALL CHANGES MADE
/	   ARE COSMETIC, BUT TECHNICALLY VIOLATE THE PAL LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION.  OS/8
/	   PAL8 IS DEFICIENT AT FLAGGING CERTAIN ERRORS THAT WILL BE PROPERLY DETECTED
/	   BY OTHER ASSEMBLY PROGRAMS SUCH AS PAL III, P?S/8 PAL, THE LAP6-DIAL/DIAL-MS
/	   ASSEMBLER AND TOPS1O PAL10.]

/	3) REMOVES INCOMPATIBILITY WITH LANGUAGE EXTENSIONS FOUND IN OTHER ASSEMBLERS
/	   [SUCH AS THE ERROR DIRECTIVE].

/	4) REMOVAL OF CONTROL-C DETECTION.  THIS IS A DESIGN FLAW: WHEN CONTROL-C IS
/	   DETECTED, THE KEYBOARD INPUT FLAG IS LEFT SET [WHICH IS THE PROPER ACTION
/	   PER SE].  THE SYSTEM HANDLER WILL BE IMMEDIATELY ENTERED AT 07600 WITH A
/	   CALL TO WRITE OUT A PORTION OF MEMORY TO THE SYSTEM SCRATCH BLOCKS; WHILE
/	   THE KEYBOARD FLAG IS NOT CHECKED DURING THE WRITE OPERATION, THE FLAG IS
/	   STILL SET.  THE NEXT INTERNAL CALL TO THE SYSTEM DEVICE HANDLER IS AN
/	   ATTEMPT TO RELOAD THE KEYBOARD MONITOR [WHICH WOULD DISPOSE OF THE KEYBOARD
/	   FLAG BY VARIOUS APPROPRIATE MEANS AFTER CLEARING THE FLAG]; HOWEVER, SINCE
/	   THIS LATEST CALL IS A READ OPERATION, THE KEYBOARD FLAG IS DETECTED CAUSING
/	   ANOTHER REBOOT TO 07600.  THUS, THE KEYBOARD FLAG IS NEVER CLEARED AS THE
/	   CODE THAT IS DESIGNED TO HANDLE IT NEVER GAINS CONTROL; THIS RESULTS IN AN
/	   INFINITE LOOP SITUATION.  [NOTE: NO OFFICIAL DEC OS/8 SYSTEM HANDLERS CHECK
/	   FOR CONTROL-C; THIS FUNCTION IS AN OPTION FOR NON-SYSTEM HANDLERS ONLY.]
/	5) DEVICE GROUP NAMES MODIFIED FOR CONSISTENCY WITH THE NON-SYSTEM HANDLERS.

/	6) MAJOR SOURCE CODE CLEANUP DEFERRED PENDING TESTING OF THE PROGRAM.  [NOTE:
/	   AMONG OTHER PROBLEMS, THE SOURCE CODE APPEARS TO BE A RECOVERY FROM A
/	   LISTING FILE AND DOES NOT CONFORM TO PDP-8 SOURCE CODE STANDARDS; OTHER
/	   THAN MORE RECENT MINOR EDITS, THERE ARE NO HORIZONTAL TAB CHARACTERS.]

/	7) RELEASE UPDATED TO VERSION F.

/	16-NOV-2015	BOB ADAMSON	FIRST MAJOR UPDATE.

/	NOTE: THIS RELEASE DATE IS APPROXIMATE.  IT IS MORE LIKELY AN EARLY DATE IN A
/	PERIOD THAT SPANS SEVERAL MONTHS.

/	NOTABLE CHANGES:

/	1) REMOVES REDUNDANT CDF INSTRUCTIONS TO SHORTEN THE CODE.

/	2) REPLACES BSW INSTRUCTIONS WITH THREE ROTATE INSTRUCTIONS EACH TO MAINTAIN
/	   COMPATIBILITY WITH ALL "FAMILY OF 8" MACHINES INSTEAD OF OMNIBUS AND NEWER.

/	3) DISABLES INTERRUPTS FROM WITHIN THE HANDLER.

/	4) ADDS CONTROL-C CHECKING TO ABORT TO OS/8 KEYBOARD MONITOR.

/	5) LIMITS CONTROL-C CHECKING TO READ OPERATIONS ONLY TO PREVENT THE SERVER
/	   FROM HANGING.

/	6) RELEASE UPDATED TO VERSION E.

/	17-FEB-2014	KYLE OWEN	INITIAL RELEASE AND UPDATES.

/	NOTABLE FEATURES:

/	1) RUNS ON OMNIBUS MACHINES ONLY.

/	2) HANDLER RELEASED AT VERSION D.

/	3) INCLUDES CO-RESIDENT HANDLER FOR SDB0:.

/	4) INCLUDES CO-RESIDENT HANDLER DUMMY FOR SDA0: [SAME AS SYS].

/	NOTE: AS ALSO APPLIES TO THE OS/8 RK8E SYSTEM HANDLER, THE CO-RESIDENT ENTRY
/	POINTS ONLY FUNCTION AS DESCRIBED IF THE SYSTEM IS BOOTED TO DRIVE UNIT 0.
/	PRESENTLY, THIS RESTRICTION IS IRRELEVANT TO THE SERIAL DISK SYSTEM HANDLER AS
/	NO EXTENDED DISK BOOTUP IS CURRENTLY SUPPORTED; HOWEVER, THE RESTRICTIONS
/	SHOULD BE DOCUMENTED SHOULD FUTURE RELEASES SUPPORT ADDITIONAL BOOTUP DRIVES.
