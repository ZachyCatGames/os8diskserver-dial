/	SDSKNS OS/8 NON-SYSTEM HANDLER

/	SERIAL INTERFACE-BASED DISK NON-SYSTEM DEVICE HANDLER [USE WITH PC SERVER].

/	LAST EDIT: 01-FEB-2021 VRS

/	EDIT HISTORY.

/	01-FEB-2021	VINCE SLYNGSTAD

/	1) REMOVED RKIE INSTRUCTION, REPLACING IT WITH A FAMILY-OF-EIGHT
/	   COMPATIBLE SOLUTION TO THE FORTRAN HANG ISSUE.
/	2) REMOVED IOT DEFINITIONS INCONSISTENT WITH USAGE ACROSS THE ENTIRE
/	   FAMILY-OF-EIGHT LINE.
/	A WORD ABOUT THE FORTRAN ISSUE IS PROBABLY APROPRIATE.  FORTRAN (AND
/	POSSIBLY OTHER SOFTWARE) WORKS BY DISABLING INTERRUPTS, CALLING US
/	(THE OS/8 DRIVER), THEN RE-ENABLING INTERRUPTS ON RETURN.  EVEN IF
/	THEY DON'T EXPLICITLY CALL US, BUT WE'VE RUN SINCE THE SYSTEM BOOT,
/	THE FORTRAN INTERRUPT SERVICE ROUTINE KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT OUR DEVICE,
/	SO IF WE LEFT A FLAG SET ON RETURN, THAT ISR WILL BE CALLED, WILL
/	FAIL TO CLEAR OUR DEVICE FLAG, WILL RETURN, AND IMMEDIATELY TAKE
/	ANOTHER INTERRUPT, ESSENTIALLY HANGING THERE. THE FLAG REMAINS
/	SET, AND NO FORWARD PROGRESS IS MADE.  EARLIER VERSIONS OF THIS
/	DRIVER USED MASKING TO PREVENT THESE INTERRUPTS, BUT ONLY OMNIBUS
/	AND LATER MACHINES IMPLEMENT MASKING INSTRUCTIONS.  IT IS THEREFORE
/	ESSENTIAL THAT THIS DRIVER NOT LEAVE FLAGS SET, IF IT IS TO RUN ON
/	OLDER SERIAL PORTS (OR NEWER ONES THAT DON'T IMPLEMENT MASKING).

/	08-FEB-2018	CHARLES LASNER	SMALL CHANGES IN PREPARATION FOR SPEED-UP.

/	NOTABLE CHANGES.

/	1) MODIFIES THE 12-BIT WORD SEND AND RECEIVE ROUTINES IN PREPARATION FOR A
/	   POTENTIAL FUTURE CHANGE TO SPEED UP THE HANDLER AT THE EXPENSE OF REQUIRING
/	   OMNIBUS MACHINES.

/	2) MINOR COSMETIC CHANGES TO CONFORM TO SOURCE CODE WIDTH LIMITATIONS OF PAL8.

/	3) RELEASE UPDATED TO VERSION H.

/	13-NOV-2016	CHARLES LASNER	BUG FIX AND MAJOR SOURCE CODE CLEANUP.

/	NOTABLE CHANGES.

/	1) FIXES BUG ASSOCIATED WITH PRE-OMNIBUS SERIAL INTERFACES BY REORDERING THE
/	   CODE THUS OVERALL LENGTH IS UNCHANGED.

/	2) THE LONG AWAITED MAJOR SOURCE CODE CLEANUP TO INCLUDE [BETTER] COMMENTS AND
/	   CONFORMANCE WITH PDP-8 SOURCE CODE CONVENTIONS.

/	6) RELEASE UPDATED TO VERSION G.

/	06-AUG-2016	CHARLES LASNER	CODE CLEANUP.

/	NOTABLE CHANGES.

/	1) ADDS THIS EDIT HISTORY.

/	2) REMOVES MINOR INCOMPATIBLE SOURCE CODE QUIRKS.  [NOTE: ALL CHANGES MADE
/	   ARE COSMETIC, BUT TECHNICALLY THE ORIGINAL CODE VIOLATED THE PAL LANGUAGE
/	   SPECIFICATION.  OS/8 PAL8 IS DEFICIENT AT FLAGGING CERTAIN ERRORS THAT WILL
/	   BE PROPERLY DETECTED BY OTHER ASSEMBLY PROGRAMS SUCH AS PAL III, P?S/8 PAL,
/	   THE LAP6-DIAL/DIAL-MS ASSEMBLER AND TOPS1O PAL10.]

/	3) REMOVES INCOMPATIBILITY WITH LANGUAGE EXTENSIONS FOUND IN OTHER ASSEMBLERS
/	   [SUCH AS THE ERROR DIRECTIVE].

/	4) DEVICE GROUP NAMES ARE MODIFIED FOR CONSISTENCY WITH THE SYSTEM HANDLER.

/	5) MAJOR SOURCE CODE CLEANUP DEFERRED PENDING TESTING OF THE PROGRAM.  [NOTE:
/	   AMONG OTHER PROBLEMS, THE SOURCE CODE APPEARS TO BE A RECOVERY FROM A
/	   LISTING FILE AND DOES NOT CONFORM TO PDP-8 SOURCE CODE STANDARDS; OTHER
/	   THAN MORE RECENT MINOR EDITS, THERE ARE NO HORIZONTAL TAB CHARACTERS.]

/	6) RELEASE UPDATED TO VERSION F.
/	16-NOV-2015	BOB ADAMSON	FIRST MAJOR UPDATE.

/	NOTE: THIS RELEASE DATE IS APPROXIMATE.  IT IS MORE LIKELY AN EARLY DATE IN A
/	PERIOD THAT SPANS SEVERAL MONTHS.

/	NOTABLE CHANGES:

/	1) REMOVES REDUNDANT CDF INSTRUCTIONS TO SHORTEN THE CODE.

/	2) REPLACES BSW INSTRUCTIONS WITH THREE ROTATE INSTRUCTIONS EACH TO MAINTAIN
/	   COMPATIBILITY WITH ALL "FAMILY OF 8" MACHINES INSTEAD OF OMNIBUS AND NEWER.

/	3) DISABLES INTERRUPTS FROM WITHIN THE HANDLER.

/	4) ADDS CONTROL-C CHECKING TO ABORT TO OS/8 KEYBOARD MONITOR.

/	5) LIMITS CONTROL-C CHECKING TO READ OPERATIONS ONLY TO PREVENT THE SERVER
/	   FROM HANGING.

/	6) SUPPORT NOW EXTENDED TO FOUR DISKS [REQUIRES UPDATED SERVER SOFTWARE].

/	7) RELEASE UPDATED TO VERSION E.

/	17-FEB-2014	KYLE OWEN	INITIAL RELEASE AND UPDATES.

/	NOTABLE FEATURES:

/	1) RUNS ON OMNIBUS MACHINES ONLY.

/	2) HANDLES TWO DISKS.

/	3) HANDLER RELEASED AT VERSION D.
