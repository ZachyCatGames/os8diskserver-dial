Volker Herrmann did some modifications of the source for the os8v4 version
of the "boot" command.  This command is used in OS/8 to switch from one
system device to another (by essentially rebooting).

This new version implements
	.BOOT/SD
in addition to the other V4 device additions.

The source file is bootvh.pa.  I have also extracted the corresponding
"boot.sv" and placed it here.  (It is packed so that every 3 bytes is a
pair of words, using the OS/8 bit ordering.)

Volker's web page about it is here:
